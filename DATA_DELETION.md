# Data Deletion Instructions

## Memosly - Account & Data Deletion

Memosly is a client app that connects to your self-hosted Memos server. The app itself does not manage user accounts or store data on any central server.

### Delete local app data
1. Go to **Android Settings → Apps → Memosly → Storage**
2. Tap **Clear Data**
3. All locally stored credentials and preferences will be removed

Alternatively, uninstall the app to remove all local data.

### Delete your server account and memo data
Your memos and account are stored on your self-hosted Memos server. To delete them:
1. Log in to your Memos server via a web browser
2. Contact your server administrator to request account deletion
3. Alternatively, if you are the server administrator, you can delete accounts directly from the server settings
