**Memosly** (the "App") is an Android client for [Memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos), a self-hosted note-taking service. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your data.

**Last updated:** February 19, 2026

## Data Collection

### Data you provide
- **Server URL, username, and password**: Used solely to authenticate with your self-hosted Memos server. Credentials are stored locally on your device and are never sent to any third party.

### Data collected automatically
- **Analytics data**: The App uses Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data such as app opens, feature usage, and crash reports. This data does not include your notes, server URL, or credentials. You can opt out of Firebase Analytics in your device's Google settings.

## Data Storage
- All memo content is stored on **your own self-hosted Memos server**. The App does not have its own server and does not store your memos.
- Authentication credentials are stored locally on your device using Android SharedPreferences.

## Third-Party Services
- **Firebase Analytics** (Google): Collects anonymous usage statistics. See [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Data Sharing
The App does **not** sell, share, or transfer your personal data to any third party, except as described above for Firebase Analytics.

## Data Deletion
You can delete all locally stored data by clearing the App's data or uninstalling it. Memo content is managed on your self-hosted server.

## Children's Privacy
The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
Updates will be posted to this page. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of any changes.
